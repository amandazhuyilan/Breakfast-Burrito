## ISA (Instruction Set Architecture
- Refers to the actual programmer-visible instruction set,serves as a boundary between the software and the hardware.
- Nearly all ISAs are classified as general purpose register architectures, where the operands are either registers or memory location
- 

## RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) 
- Focuses more on: 
  - Exploitation of instruction-level parallelism (initially through pipelining and later through multiple instruction issue)
  - Uses of caches (initially in simple forms and later using more sophiscated organizations and optimizations)
