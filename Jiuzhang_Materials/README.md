### Notes

##### Open/Closed Hashing 

- Open hashing: elements line up on the same slot if hashed to the same slot.
  - Not effective when looking up an element that is hashed into same slot.
  
- Closed hashing: elemnt will go to the next slot if hashed into the same slot.
  - Not effective for deleting, chain effect, not recommended.
