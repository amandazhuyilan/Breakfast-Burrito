### Reading notes for *Think Python - How to Think like a Computer Scientist* (2nd Edition)

#### Chapter 1 - 10
- *Problem Solving* : The ability to formulate a problem, think creatively about solutions, and express a solutions clearly and accurately.
- *Programming*: The process fo breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with one of the basic instructions.
- *Interpreter*: A program that reads another program and executes it.

- *Fuction*: A named sequence of statements that performs a computation.
- *Module*: A file that contains a collection of related functions.
- *Argument*: A value provided to a function when it is called - this value is assigned to the corresponding *parameter* in the function.
- *Keyword Argument*: An argument that includes the name of the parameter as a "keyword".
- *Parameter*: A named used in a function to refer to the value passed as an *argument*.
- *Interface*: A description of how to use a function, including the name and description of the argument and the return value. The interface is like a contract between a function and a caller. The caller agrees to provide certain parameters and the function agrees to do certain work.
- *Reduce*: A processing pattern that traverses a sequence and accumulates the elements into a single result.
- *Map*: A processing pattern that traverses a sequence and performs an operation on each element.
- *Filter*: A processing pattern that traverses a list and selects elements that satisify some criterion.
- *Object*: Something that a variable can refer to. An object has a type and a value.
- *Equivalent*: Having the same value.
- *Identical*: Being the same object.

- *String*s are immutable, *list*s are mutable.
- To check whether two variables *refer* to the same object (with a type and a value) / are *identical*, use `is` operator.
  To check whether two variables are *equivalent*, use `==` operator.
