**Tips on Developing a Good Software for your Customers**
- **Bi-weekly show-and-tells**
  - Your customers might not actually know what they want, even if they hand you with a detailed list of requirements.
  One way to get around this is to give a show-and-tell every two weeks to your customers - show them a piece of what you think should be delievered and check if that is in line with what they wanted.
  - Show-and-tells can also be useful for your team if you want feedback.
- **Take the time to do big picture stuff**
  - Make time for PPDs.
